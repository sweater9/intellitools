# Knowledge search intelligence: relevance report

Run: `node tests/knowledge-search-relevance.mjs`. Dataset: `tests/data/search-relevance-dataset.json` (303 queries; methodology is in the file header).

**Before** is the unmodified lexical engine (`knowledge/search-core.mjs`). **After** is `searchIntelligent` over the same committed index and lexicon. The solid-match threshold (`minSolidScore`) was not changed. Semantic search stays opt-in and was not used for these numbers.

## Headline

| Metric | Before | After | Change |

| Out-of-scope / ambiguous queries kept weak (38 queries) | 92.1% | 100% | +7.9% |
| Wrong confident answers (count, lower is better) | 12 | 0 | -12 |
| Tool recommendation recall (25 queries) | 20% | 100% | +80% |
| Unexpected tool recommendations (count) | 0 | 0 | +0 |
| Mean reciprocal rank of the first right guide | 0.861 | 0.978 | +0.1 |

Protected queries (passed before): 221. Regressions among them: 0.
