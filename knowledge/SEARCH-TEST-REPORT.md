# Knowledge search test report

Run: `node tests/knowledge-search.mjs`

Judgements are against the guides that actually exist. A related page is not marked pass when the corpus does not answer the question. The solid-match threshold was not lowered to hide those gaps.

Queries: 49
Pass: 48
Weak: 1
Miss: 0

## Insufficient Knowledge coverage
- Compare two prompt versions — No guide about diffing prompts. Prompt Diff is the matching tool. Top signal: system-prompts (25). Tool: prompt-diff.

## Routing checks
These are the behaviour checks, not a lowered score cutoff. A failure exits non-zero.

All routing checks matched the expected page, tool and gap.
